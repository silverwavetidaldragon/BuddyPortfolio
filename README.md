# BuddyPortfolio
Submission to WebbU Hackathon April 2023. Theme: Personal Portfolio. 

This is a personal portfolio for me, the fictional dog “Buddy”.

This site its completely unnecessary for the sake of the hackathon. It was developed using following technologies:

Prototyping: Pen&Paper and Figma
Developing: Mac laptop, Visual Studio Code
HTML and CSS
Hosting: Local and WordPress
WordPress as CMS


OBS! The layout doesn't look very great currently in a very wide window.
#The coolest features
– [ x ] Responsive layout to resizing
– [ x ] From scratch layout and design 
– [ x ] Coded into a WordPress theme, making it easily customizable

#Yet to be implemented
– [ ]Content closer to my personal portfolio
– [ ]Minor cosmetic layout fixes (alignments)
– [ ]Fully clickable tabs
